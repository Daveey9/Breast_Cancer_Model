# Breast_Cancer_Model
# Dataset
One of the most well-known and straightforward binary classification datasets is the Wisconsin breast cancer dataset. 
Attribute Information:
1) ID number
2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)
Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:
a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
c) perimeter
d) area
e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
i) symmetry
j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
All feature values are recoded with four significant digits.
Missing attribute values: none
Class distribution: 357 benign, 212 malignant

# Project
Using data from Wisconsin, this experiment is being carried out to identify the cancer kind.
KNN and LogisticRegression models are being used in this instance.With this study, we hope to identify the characteristics that are most useful in forecasting whether a cancer will be malignant or benign as well as discover broad trends that could help us choose the right model and hyperparameters.Whether the breast cancer is benign or aggressive is the main objective.I have utilised machine learning classification techniques to fit a function that can forecast the discrete class of new data in order to do this.
